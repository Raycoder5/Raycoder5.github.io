            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey! My name is Ramone and ever since I was a little kid, I was OBSESSED with computers and how they work. I mostly
                liked computers because I could play videogames on them, but as I grew older, I came to understand computers can 
                be used for more than just videogames. My love for coding began in middle school when I was introduced to computer 
                programming on a website called <a href="https://code.org">code.org</a>. In my free time between assignments in 
                middle school, I would complete some of the puzzles on code.org for fun! My teacher told me that computer programming 
                in the real world is similar to some of the exercises on code.org and this made me so happy because I was already 
                pretty proficient at completing the puzzles!
            </p>
            <p>
                From that moment on, I knew I wanted to become a computer programmer. As I progressed in my academic career and 
                learned more about the different job fields that encompass a "computer programmer", I settled on becoming a website 
                developer. I'm interested in becoming a website developer because of the origins of my love for computer programming. 
                code.org got me really used to the code I write being linked to a graphical element of an interface. I feel it's easier 
                for me to understand what my code is doing when I can visualize it.
