        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b>  I was born in Kingston, Jamaica
                 but I was mostly raised in the United States. I lived in the Bronx in New York city
                  from kindergarten to 3rd grade and then I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina
                   when I was in the 4th grade and I have lived here ever since. I really like
                    Charlotte because it is a major city but does not feel overwhelming like
                     New York city.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> My very first job was a lifeguard job at a local pool
                 in 2021. I quickly got promoted to lifeguard manager and finished out the summer in
                  that position. I then got an internship the next summer in 2022 as an installation
                   technician installing smart boards at local high schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg
                    area. Finally, I recently completed an internship with Fifth Third bank in
                     Cincinnati, Ohio and I really enjoyed my time there. I will use that experience
                      to try and get an internship in Charlotte next summer in 2024.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I went to a special high school called a middle college
                 that allowed me to start college halfway through my high school career. So by the time
                  I graduated from high school, I was already halfway through college. I then got
                   accepted to UNC Charlotte and started attending in the fall semester of 2022.</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I have taken 1 class in high school that was related
                 to website design and development and I actually liked it! So ever since I have been
                  wanting to dive back into the field to see what it would be like to do it more
                   seriously and even professionally at some point in the future. I am really looking
                    forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this class!</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> I primarily use MacOS on my M2 Macbook Pro but I
                 also have this windows laptop that I use occasionally for gaming and I think I would
                  like to start getting more familiar with windows and programming on a windows machine.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3130 - Human-Centered Design:</b> I want to be a mobile or web designer
                         and developer so knowing how humans interact with design in an interface would
                          be very advantageous to my future career prospects. I also just like seeing
                           my designs come to fruition through the medium of code.</li>
                    <li><b>HONR 3700-H01 - Comic books, manga, and graphic novels:</b> I am in the
                         honors college and we are required to take a 3700 course and this was one
                          of the subjects I was interested in. I frequently read manga like Demon
                           slayer, Fire force, Jujutsu Kaisen, One piece, and Black clover. This
                            will be the course that I relax in and enjoy reading different stories
                             from different authors.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development:</b> I want to know how to break
                         into the field of website development because I am more of a visual coder
                          that needs to see the results of my code in real time. I eventually want
                           to be a full stack developer so learning front end first will be
                            advantageous.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Privacy:</b> I know that websites are
                         constantly being attacked by malicious hackers so knowing how to defend my
                          website will be helpful if I want to get into information security in the
                           future.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms:</b> I am a computer science major so
                         I am required to take this course to complete my concentration in
                          information technology. I am not really interested in discrete
                           mathematics but it seems useful for programming certain logical
                            statements.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> I ride a red Onewheel around campus
                 very often so if you see me, dont be afraid to say hello! If you dont know what
                  a Onewheel is, search it up on Google, there are like 8 people on campus
                   that own one.</li>
            <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I love Marvel movies and anime so if you are interested
                 in either of those things, please reach out to me! I'd love to talk about all the
                  theories I have about Marvel and some of the anime I watch.</li>
            <li>I will be graduating in Fall semester of 2024!</li>
            <li>I was born in Kingston, Jamaica but moved with my family to the United States when I was
                1. I lived in New York until the 2nd grade and then moved with my Dad to Charlotte, NC.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will introduce myself here.</p>
