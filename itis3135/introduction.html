                    <li><b>Personal Background:</b>  I was born in Kingston, Jamaica
                        but I was mostly raised in the United States. I lived in the Bronx in New York city
                        from kindergarten to 3rd grade and then I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina
                        when I was in the 4th grade and I have lived here ever since. I really like
                            Charlotte because it is a major city but does not feel overwhelming like
                            New York city.</li>
                    <li><b>Professional Background:</b> My very first job was a lifeguard job at a local pool
                        in 2021. I quickly got promoted to lifeguard manager and finished out the summer in
                        that position. I then got an internship the next summer in 2022 as an installation
                        technician installing smart boards at local high schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg
                            area. Finally, I recently completed an internship with Fifth Third bank in
                            Cincinnati, Ohio and I really enjoyed my time there. I will use that experience
                            to try and get an internship in Charlotte next summer in 2024.</li>
                    <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I went to a special high school called a middle college
                        that allowed me to start college halfway through my high school career. So by the time
                        I graduated from high school, I was already halfway through college. I then got
                        accepted to UNC Charlotte and started attending in the fall semester of 2022.</li>
                    <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I have taken 1 class in high school that was related
                        to website design and development and I actually liked it! So ever since I have been
                        wanting to dive back into the field to see what it would be like to do it more
                        seriously and even professionally at some point in the future. I am really looking
                            forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this class!</li>
                    <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> I primarily use MacOS on my M2 Macbook Pro but I
                        also have this windows laptop that I use occasionally for gaming and I think I would
                        like to start getting more familiar with windows and programming on a windows machine.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>ITIS 3130 - Human-Centered Design:</b> I want to be a mobile or web designer
                                and developer so knowing how humans interact with design in an interface would
                                be very advantageous to my future career prospects. I also just like seeing
                                my designs come to fruition through the medium of code.</li>
                            <li><b>HONR 3700-H01 - Comic books, manga, and graphic novels:</b> I am in the
                                honors college and we are required to take a 3700 course and this was one
                                of the subjects I was interested in. I frequently read manga like Demon
                                slayer, Fire force, Jujutsu Kaisen, One piece, and Black clover. This
                                    will be the course that I relax in and enjoy reading different stories
                                    from different authors.</li>
                            <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design and Development:</b> I want to know how to break
                                into the field of website development because I am more of a visual coder
                                that needs to see the results of my code in real time. I eventually want
                                to be a full stack developer so learning front end first will be
                                    advantageous.</li>
                            <li><b>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security & Privacy:</b> I know that websites are
                                constantly being attacked by malicious hackers so knowing how to defend my
                                website will be helpful if I want to get into information security in the
                                future.</li>
                            <li><b>ITSC 2175 - Logic and Algorithms:</b> I am a computer science major so
                                I am required to take this course to complete my concentration in
                                information technology. I am not really interested in discrete
                                mathematics but it seems useful for programming certain logical
                                    statements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> I ride a red Onewheel around campus
                        very often so if you see me, dont be afraid to say hello! If you dont know what
                        a Onewheel is, search it up on Google, there are like 8 people on campus
                        that own one.</li>
                    <li><b>I'd also like to Share:</b> I love Marvel movies and anime so if you are interested
                        in either of those things, please reach out to me! I'd love to talk about all the
                        theories I have about Marvel and some of the anime I watch.</li>
                    <li>I will be graduating in Fall semester of 2024!</li>
                    <li>I was born in Kingston, Jamaica but moved with my family to the United States when I was
                        1. I lived in New York until the 2nd grade and then moved with my Dad to Charlotte, NC.
