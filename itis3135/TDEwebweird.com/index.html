                <h2>Thompson Design Enterprise's services</h2>
                <p>Our founder once told Steve Jobs in 1347 that "With great purple comes great power!" We have 
                    taken that to heart and in the 676 years of our company's history, we have always had the 
                    motto "Purple has power!" Our founder Ramone Thompson also had multiple paintings in the 
                    Louvre in Paris, France so we followed his footsteps and now help famous artists 
                    like Banksy, mr doodle, and Swoozie.
