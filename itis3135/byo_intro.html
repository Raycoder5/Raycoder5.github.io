I lived in the Bronx in New York city from kindergarten to 3rd grade and then I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina when I was in the 4th grade and I have lived here ever since.

I quickly got promoted to lifeguard manager and finished out the summer in that position. I then got an internship the next summer in 2022 as an installation technician installing smart boards at local high schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg area. Finally, I recently completed an internship with Fifth Third bank in Cincinnati, Ohio and I really enjoyed my time there. I will use that experience to try and get an internship in Charlotte next summer in 2024.</textarea>
