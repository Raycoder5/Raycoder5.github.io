                    <li><p>Logan's submission link does lead to a page with links to the client project.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names.</p></li>
                    <li><p>DESIGN</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>The page has good contrast/font sizing for easy readability.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The page does have site colors and fonts using the standard .css file.</p></li>
                            <li><p>CRAP</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><p>Contrast - There is good contrast on the page! None of the many colors on the page clash or make text hard to read.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Repetition - There is good repetition on the home page with the multi-color buttons. I would suggest adding something else to the home page so the navigation links can go in the header like all of the other pages. There are no header nav links on the home page which is not consistent.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Alignment - There is overall good alignment because most of the content is in the center of the page. I would suggest centering the form on the contact.html page.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Proximity - Once the user clicks on any of the multi-color navigation buttons on the home page, the nav links go to the top of the page and the "news" and "meet the creators" links are put together and look like one link. Besides this issue, the site has good proximity.</p></li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><p>The page has a header, main, and footer like the assignment requirements state.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The header technically has the brand name at the top consistently but it is an icon and not a h1 with the text "BLNC" on all pages. I would suggest adding a h1 with the text "BLNC" on all pages per the assignment requirements.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The first thing in the main is a h1 tag on all the pages except the home page which has a div tag as the first element. I would suggest changing this so that the main on each page begins with a h2 tag that has the name of the page and does not have the brand name in it like the home page h1 does. Refer to the assignment requirements.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The page does have "Designed by Phinney's Consulting" at the bottom consistently but no brand tagline in a consistent location.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The footer has the validation links for CSS and HTML on all pages.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Other missed requirements from client project part 2:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><p>The home page is called blnc_client_project instead of index.html like the assignment requirements state.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>The nav bar is not in the same position on all pages. On the home page the nav bar is not at the top of the page in the header.</p></li>
                                </ol>
