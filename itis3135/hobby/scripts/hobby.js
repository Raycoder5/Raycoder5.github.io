        I first got my Onewheel on January/24th/2023 as a car replacement. I had noticed that I would go
        short distances very often in my car that wasted a lot of gas. The Onewheel pint that I got 
        perfectly covered my needs for those short trips to Walmart or the bus stop outside my 
        neighborhood.

        I had a car at the time I got my Onewheel and I named my car Emma. Seeing as this Onewheel pint 
        was supposed to be a short distance car replacement, I named it Emma mini. My car was also the 
        same shade of red as my Onewheel so it was perfect.

    <p><a href="https://onewheel.com/">Onewheel</a> is an U.S based company that sells 
        personal electric vehicles (PEVs).
        The Onewheel is an electric skateboard type vehicle that uses a rubber go-kart tire 
        instead of skateboard wheels. There is only one wheel on the board and that is where 
        it gets its name from. The tire is air filled like a normal car tire so this allows 
        riders to go through a lot more variations of terrain in comparison to a normal electric 
        skateboard. As of 2023, Onewheel has 4 models of Onewheels that they sell: the Onewheel 
        Pint, the Onewheel Pint x, the Onewheel GT, and the Onewheel GT-S.
    </p>
    <p>
        The difference between the models is range and speed. The Onewheel pint can go 16 mph with 
        a range of 6-8 miles and the Onewheel GT can go 20 mph with a range of 20-32 miles. 
        There is also the Onewheel GT-S model that can go 25 mph but has a lower range of 16-25 miles. All 4
        models of the board are assembled in California, USA. The founder and CEO Kyle Doerksen
        intentionally kept production of the Onewheel in the U.S because he believes in giving
        the people here at home a stable job instead of exporting the labor to China. With this
        in mind, the "Made in USA" stamp of approval does come with an increased price tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are the price tags of each model as of 2023:

        My Onewheel journey technically began in 2021 when I got my first skateboard. I just randomly
        got one off Amazon.com and decided to teach myself and it worked. From there, I looked 
        into getting an electric skateboard and that is how I learned about Onewheels. I saw them as 
        superior to skateboards because they could go over dirt, grass, ice, and gravel without 
        stopping. I mostly ride on roads but if I wanted to go off road it would be nice to not have 
        to get off my board.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the image above, you can see what a stock Onewheel pint looks like fresh out the box.
        I customized my board so it would fit my vibe a little better. I also added a fender so if I am 
        riding in the rain, the wheel won't throw a bunch of water and dirt up onto my shoes and pants.

    </figure>
    <p>
        I primarily ride my Onewheel on sidewalks, roads, and grass. I've never gone offroading with 
        my board because i'm scared I might puncture the tire or fall and hurt myself. The Onewheel pint 
        can go offroading but the bigger models like the Onewheel GT and Onewheel GT-S are better suited 
        for that. The aforementioned Onewheels also have an option to get a treaded tire for more grip 
        offroad.
    </p>
    <p>
        As seen in the picture above, my Onewheel has a slick racing tire so I have much better grip on 
        roads as compared to dirt and gravel. I am currently thinking about upgrading and getting the 
        Onewheel GT because I want the extra range and speed. The Onewheel GT is $2,300 USD BEFORE taxes 
        so it might be a while before I can get my hands on one.
