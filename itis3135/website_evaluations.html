                <section><h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a> (good CRAP principles)</h3>
                    <p>apple.com is the offical site of the company Apple inc that famously created the 
                        iPhone and Macbook.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast - Apple's company colors are black, grey, and white so all of the 
                            products on their main page stand out against a black or white background.</li>
                        <li>Repetition - The black and white boxes that the iPhones and apple watches are 
                            in are the same size and are alternating. There is also a consistent grid as the 
                            user scrolls down the page.</li>
                        <li>Alignment - The products on the page are centered in the black/white backgrounds 
                            they are placed in. The black/white boxes are also in a consistent grid</li>
                        <li>Proximity - The products have ample padding between eachother and are not bunched up. 
                            A customer would not be confused which product they are clicking on.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section><h3><a href="https://www.mecksheriff.com/">mecksheriff.com</a> (bad CRAP principles)</h3>
                    <p>mecksheriff.com is the official site of the Mecklenburg county sheriff.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast - The Mecklenburg county sheriff's office logo in the top left is not contrasting 
                            enough against the green header background of the site. The font of the logo is too small/thin.</li>
                        <li>Repetition - There are not a lot of repeating elements that are of the same size or color. 
                            Also, the color of two sections on the site do not have the same color green.</li>
                        <li>Alignment - The content does not follow a consistent grid. Some images are closer to the 
                            edge of the page than other images.</li>
                        <li>Proximity - The Mecklenburg county sheriff's office logo in the top left does not have 
                            enough spacing between the bottom of the logo and the bottom of the green header 
                            background. Also, the sheriff badges that act as links to the page's social media are 
                            too close to some of the content and arrows. </li>
                    </ul>
